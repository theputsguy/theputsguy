    title: "HEDGING TRIGGERED",
    date: "April 8, 2021",
    body: 'Just when we thought we survived the tech-centric sell-off, we got very unlucky with two of our writes. Within HOURS of execution of some put sales, we got the dreaded "Secondary offering news" on both of our writes-- the results were some tough results to swallow and all of our March profits wiped out and then some. Through the month of March, we are currently sitting on $15,000 in gains, on a 100k trading size- A couple obvious points here-1) 2021 is not 2020 in terms of returns- It is a battle out there every trading day.  We are seeing intense profit-taking from retail traders very quickly, costing some of the underlying equities to give back their gains and fast. 2) ThePutsGuy Index of stocks is off more than 10 percent from its highs. Reminder, ThePutsGuy index is a proprietary index, weighted the same way the SP500 is weighted, however it features only the equities we have the highest conviction on and are willing to write puts, with the expectation we will hold the stock if the equity is "put" to us.So what next-With the index in "bear" territory, it has triggered my automatic hedging on all trades- We can always hedge, as it reduces our maximum loss, but when the market was going straight-up, it was costing us profits. When the index is "Bearish", I execute hedging on all trades. For instance, members will notice I have begun executing some long calendar spreads as well as some Put Spreads- Managing losses and bringing in a steady income stream is our number one goal, and we will not stray from this idea. Again, this is an income play only, so do not get frustrated when we achieve a maximum gain on a trade and the underlying stock goes parabolic- we are here for income!Other notes- WE ARE STILL WAITING ON LEGAL/SITE STUFF BEFORE WE GO LIVE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC- WE ARE STILL IN LIMITED BETA- THE GOAL WAS 4/1, BUT IT COULD BE ANOTHER FEW WEEKS AT THE MAXIMUM- THANK YOU FOR THE CONTINUED INTEREST IN JOINING, I PROMISE, WE WILL BE LIVE SOON FOR ALL WHO WANTS IN!',

    date: "March 15, 2021",
    body: "We are having a fantastic March! Here at ThePutsGuy we not only stayed alive during the intense sell-off in the NASDAQ, we appear to be heading through it all with nice gains! We are sitting on 1 equity position year to date. That's 42 trades made since the inception of the site, and we have a realized loss on just two trades! We currently have only two open positions that we opened before the NASDAQ meltdown,  as of this writing, would be profitable if they expired today.  We are at a total gain (realized +/- CMV of open positions) of just under $25,000 in under four months--(on the base $100,000 account) and we have some positions that we feel strongly that will add to the profit soon.Members will start getting a daily recap email on our holdings, what we are looking for coming up and a place that I will provide more answers to questions that our clients email (name withheld)Please reach out to theputsguy@theputsguy.com with questions, sign up questions etc",

    date: "March 9, 2021",
    body: "PutsGuy again- Its's mind numbing to look at your account when all you see is a \"Sea of Red\" Our members can attest, we have been sitting on our hands lately. We have yet to sell a put during the last 5 trading sessions, by far the longest stretch of the year.Despite that, we still have our 5 existing open contracts and one open equity position that was called to us at the beginning of the month. Amongst those five positions, two of the five are in the green, one is above the break/even price if it were put to us today, and the other two are down-- considering the market conditions, that's a huge success. We are going to be quicker to take profits, if/when they come -- and will continue to hold the one stock we have been assigned.. still stalking a time to begin writing a covered call on that position.Remember, tread carefully, never have 100 percent of your account at risk!!",

    title: "Panic on the Nasdaq",
    date: "March 4, 2021",
    body: "I've sold Puts through every market condition starting with the dot.com bubble- Could this be another massive dip? I don't have a clue and nobody on this planet knows. Treasury yields approaching 2% is spooking the NASDAQ- 2% - yes 2 %- While I don't want to get why this is so inherently stupid, and why I don't think this is the primary cause of this dip (are the suits punishing the retail and showing who's in control?), I do want to remind everybody why we sell Puts and our philosophy. We sell puts to generate an income. We sell puts on stocks that we want to own long term if we get them called to us. If we were doing this income strategy with covered calls, we would be in much deeper doo-doo , as we would have had to purchase the equites before we could get income from them.. We write most of our plays for 5-15% percent BELOW the current market price! Obviously we have and have had some stocks put to us, but our cost basis on those equities, which we LOVE is significantly better than had we written covered calls or just purchased stock. The NASDAQ/TECH will be back - stay invested in companies that have great management, a growth story and something you use or would use on a daily basis! Soon we may get a sideways or a bull market again, and selling puts will continue to prosper. Lets just not eat away much more of our GAINST THEPUTSGUY TEAM! ",

    title: "FEB REALIZED RETURNS",
    date: "February 28, 2021",
    body: 'A lot of us are very relieved to turn the calendar and hope the NASDAQ settles down a bit! After a realized gain of more than $16,000 on a $100,000 account in the month of January, we expected February to be very volatile and we were not wrong! While we have realized gains of $9105, or about 9%, it\'s safe to say, we are fortunate to just be in the green after a ridiculous month in the markets. We say realized, that means that is the profit/loss that has been closed out. We are sitting on a sizable loss now for 12 trading days, that we have not closed out, and really do not plan on selling that quickly. We love the stock and expect it to rebound nicely, especially with some of the major fund managers buying that equity in bunches! Through two months, we have a realized gain of more than $25,000 -- a number we probably would have been ok with over a 12-month period. Heading into March, we currently have four outstanding puts that are "open" and one stock that we may elect to write some covered calls against, or outright sell it if it bounces back to its 2021 highs. (Members have the full intel on the plan) February confirmed a lot of what we preach here- the markets can turn on you in a hurry and not being overexposed at anytime is very important! We still are in a heavy earnings period, which reduces our preferred equity list to write calls against.  Our biggest in terms of trading days held and profit, was a total of three days for a $1400 profit. We wrote LGVW 17.50s expiration 2-19, 20 contracts pocketed us $1800 and we quickly closed them out by paying $400- netting the 1400.',

    body: 'The Nasdaq 2.46% single-day drop, while not fun, shows the importance of properly managing your account. We were in no rush to take any new positions after several of our trades closed on the 2-19 expiration date. Currently the portfolio is about 40 percent cash, which is deliberate with such a busy earnings time. For the most part, we avoid selling puts with earnings during the trade- although if we see an opportunity, we still will take it--(APPS trade) Coming off a 16.5% gain in January and some sizable gains early in this month - we are looking for the market to come to us and not force anything. We don\'t try and call "tops" and "bottoms" of the markets. Study resistance points, and avoid writing when a stock is trading below its 50-sma.',

    title: "JANUARY RESULTS",
    date: "January 31, 2021",
    body: "We got through January with a realized gain of $16,380 - Remember the account size we are using as the base case is  $100,000. You can do the math, it was a fantastic month. We measure our performance against the PUTWRite Index 'PUTW', which returned approx $1,300 on a $100,000 account. Of our 20 closed trades, we took a loss on just one, a minimal loss of $550 - as we sold the shares a day after having them put to us. We saw some big gains on the underlying stocks we were selling, which resulted in an average holding period of 8 trading days. Giving us plenty of opportunities to find more trades to expand our growth. Our longest holding has been 17 days and still going. Our most successful trade in terms of days holding and profit was $1700 for less than 4 holding days. Again, we have no problem exiting a trade very quickly if we made some good money! While most of January was fantastic, the last week was a bit rough on the markets. Uncertainty is running rampant in the markets right now. We stayed away from the inflated premiums for the most part, but we did sell about 30 Nokia contracts-- the day of the trade, NOK stock actually traded up over 70 percent - while the PUT premiums actually went the wrong way on us- that’s how crazy the WSB plays -- We closed out 24 hours later with a very modest $210 gain.The market is volatile right now, we have open positions on numerous equities that are in danger of being put to us, although we still have more than two weeks on some of those plays.",
